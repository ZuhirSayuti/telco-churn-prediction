# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

The goal is to identify customers likely to leave the service so businesses can take preventive action.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Target variable: `Churn` (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

---

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Random Forest achieved the best performance with ~80% accuracy.
